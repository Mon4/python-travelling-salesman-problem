# python-travelling-salesman-problem

Aim of this project is to write Tabu serach algorithm of searching the shortest way for travelling salesman and later to choose the best hyperparameters.

The parameters was checked like:
- number of iterations
- number of iterations without improvement
- lenght of tabu list
- type of neighbourhood

There were 3 lenght of input data: 48, 76,	127

The best results was for:
type of neighbourhood: invertion
lenght of tabu list: 150
number of iterations: 10000

The results were better than from Solver.
